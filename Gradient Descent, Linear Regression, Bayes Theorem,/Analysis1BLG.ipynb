The reason being is that intially your choice is made on the odds of 1/3 . when the new door is revealed with the goat you know whats inside of it so you will not switch to that door. At this point your odds are now 2/3 so you have more of an incentive to switch. If you do switch on average you will win the car 2 out of 3 times.\n",
